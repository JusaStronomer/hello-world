# hello-world

This is a tutorial repository.

The aim of this is to create a C++ console application in which I can apply everything I learn about the language and programing in general.

## About me

I am by no means a programmer... I am actually a mixture of many different things:  
- I have dedicated 5 years of my life studying law (and I obtained a bachelor's degree);
- I have been teaching music (piano and theory) since 2012;
- I have been studying Physics since 2016;
- I spend most of my time studying japanese, specially 古文, reading manga, playing games and watching anime.

## My history with programming

My first contact with anything programming-relatable is learning the absolute basics of Bash so I could perform simple tasks on my Linux machine. I have been using Ubuntu (the simplest to use Linux distro, I believe) since 2010. Where I live (Brazil, State of Parana, City of Londrina), pirating Windows OSs and Microsoft's softwares is common practice... I always hated it, so using Linux, despite initially being a shocking experience, was one of the best things to happen in my life.

My interest for programming started in 2015, at Khan Academy... I have been doing their programming courses until the preset. That means I am more familiar with JavaScript than any other language, which is reinforced by the fact that I have been working with the Google Script API to design and maintain a Database for my music school.

In 2017, I took a introductory C++ course in college and have been in love with the language ever since! Following the work of YouTubers like TheChernoProject and Suraj Sharma, I have a daily supply of content to preserve this love.

However what made me start working on GitHub and really learning C++ is my wish to contribute to the OpenMW project. If it weren't for that, I would just keep entertaining myself by watching other people code (specially the 2 YouTubers previously mentioned). I intend to document my progress until I am good enough to work on a real OpenMW Issue, and maybe beyond.

## Progress Report
[2019-03-06] I was able to install the Virtual Studio Code IDE in my Ubuntu 18.04 machine. Never said I hate Microsoft! What I hated was piracy... so I am very happy that VS Code is open source!  
[2019-03-06] I remembered a lot of things C++ beginners learn and decided to try to use them in my hello word program.  
[2019-03-07] It's notable to mention that I remembered how to pass by refference! It always confused me how the location of the ampersand (whether it's attached to the end of the type or to the beginning of the variable) "says" different things.  
[2019-03-10] I learned to make bash scripts to compile the code (using g++) and to clean the directory before a new compilation. Up until now, I had only used bash in the shell for real time tasks... this is my first time writing scripts!  
[2019-03-10] I learned to make a basic makefile! Since this is not something I will be doing all the time, I am afraid of, eventually, just forgeting how to do it...
[2019-03-11] I started learning how to manage multiple files. I am working on it in a different branch... for now, only header files with functions, not classes and multiple cpp files... the next step will be learning how to compile everything and update the makefile.
