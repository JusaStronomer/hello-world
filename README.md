# hello-world
This is a tutorial repository.

I am a law bachelor, physics student, music teacher and wannabe contributor to opensource projects.  
My interest for programming started with Linux... I have been a Ubuntu user since about 2010, learning random things here and there to use this OS.
In 2015, I learned a bit of JavaScript at Khan Academy (KA).  
In 2016, I kept doing a bunch of KA courses and exploring many different languages.  
In 2017, I took a C++ introductory course at college and have been in love with C++ ever since (even though I am still super newbie).  
In 2018, I learned how to use the Google Script API to make a amateurish, but functional, database for the music school I work at. Before that, I had spent a bunch of time trying to grasp something about database design at KA's SQL course and with VBA tutorials on YouTube.  
In the present, I have my eyes on OpenMW and really wish to be able to offer some contribution to the project. Learning git is my first step towards that goal.  

The "main.cpp" file aims at refreshing my mind on everything I learned about C++ in the past, so I can understand where I am at and how to proceed learning new things from there... I am shocked to see how much of a newbie I am... however, I intend to fix that in the following months!  

## Refresh Report
[2019-03-07] I realized I need to learn how to link libraries in VSCode.
