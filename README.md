# hello-world
This is a tutorial repository.

I am a law bachelor, physics student, music teacher and lover of japanese culture.
In 2015, I learned a bit of JavaScript at Khan Academy (KA).
In 2016, I kept doing a bunch of KA courses and exploring many different languages.
In 2017, I took a C++ introductory course at college and have been in love with C++ ever since.
In 2018, I learned how to use the Google Script API to make a amateurish, but functional, database for the music school I work at. Before that, I had learnt a bunch of things about database design at KA's SQL course and with VBA tutorials on YouTube.
In the present, I have my eyes on OpenMW and really wish to be able to offer some contribution to the project. Learning git is my first step towards that goal.
